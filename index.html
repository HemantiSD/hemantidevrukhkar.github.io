      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        With deep experience across hardware, software, and enterprise solutions, I understand technology from the
        physical layer on the ground to the intelligence layer that drives strategic decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the AI era, I focus on connecting devices, data, and decision-making—building systems that are intelligent,
        scalable, and grounded in real operational value.
